# 1. Javascript DrumKit ( _drum_ )
---

Based on a [Javascript 30 course](https://javascript30.com/)  by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com) in which you build 30 micro projects with only `vanilla JS`, no jQuery and :poop:.

Also _Wes Bos_ is an amazing teacher!! :thumbsup:

Used this [Scotch.io course](https://scotch.io/courses/using-gulp-as-a-build-system) to learn gulp and make this awesome template. Try [browserSync](https://browsersync.io/docs/gulp), you are gonna fall in :heart_eyes: love with it !!

## What I learned
- `transitionend` event instead of setTimeout
- => function is ES6 without explicit return and `function` keyword
- key code and related JS events
- Using audio with JS


## TODO
- Documentation
- Restructure boilerplate files and folder
- Make amends to boilerplate gulp file
- ~~Publishing to Github~~
- ~~Online with Github Sites~~
- Change subdomain to labs i.e. `labs.kshitijpurwar.com`
